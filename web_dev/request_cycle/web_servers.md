Question 2: What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

- Open Source Software
- Release versions early and often for testing
- May have bugs that need solving
- Features generally go through the alpha, beta, and final stages



Question 3: In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

- A Virtual Private Server is a service that emulates a physical server but only exists as part of another server or computer.  VPS's work like physical servers and have operating systems.  Even though a VPS does not have a separate CPU or separate memory, it is possible to simulate an environment with certain specifications, including CPU speed, memory, etc.  A VPS can be set up fairly easily, at a low cost, and without needing the physical materials.




Question 4: Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

As the root user, you are able to change anything you want without notification from the computer.  In this situation, you would be much more likely to make a costly mistake.  Additionally, the root is less secure, meaning viruses would have access to all parts of your computer.
