<!--
1. Semantic tags make the code more readable and add structure to the different parts of the page.  THe most useful tag so far has been <nav>.
2. The browser reads your code from top to bottom.  Whatever you write first it will show at the top and the pattern continues down the document.
3. We learned you can make your own snippets.  Snippets seem very useful for code that we will use often, like the HTML skeleton or a table skeleton.  I definitely see myself using more code in the future.
4. Understanding how to build a snippet using the unfamiliar code and process was a bit of a challenge.  Also, semantic tags seem useful and logical but I'm not sure when and how often they should be used.
